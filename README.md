# Crystal Text-to-Visual-Speech (TTVS) Engine

Crystal TTVS engine is a real-time audio-visual Multilingual (Mandarin, Cantonese and English) speech synthesizer with a 3D expressive avatar.

The avatar model is parameterized according to the MPEG-4 facial animation standard, which offers a compact set of facial animation parameters (FAPs) and feature points (FPs) to enable realization of 20 visemes and 7 facial expressions.  A set of TTVS engines (including Mandarin, Cantoense and English) converts the input phoneme sequence with time information into visemes and then further into FAP sequence.  The 3D avatar animation is then rendered according to the FAP sequence by the Xface open source toolkit.

### Framework

* Real-time facial animation to generate synchronized lip movements on the avatar's face
* Natual facial expression and head movement with human-like avatar
* Platform independent framework for both stationary and embedded applications

### Support of Multilingual

The engine supports TTVS in (but not limited to) the following languages: Chinese Mandarin, Cantonese, and English.  You can actually implement your TTVS engine by overriding the **CSTHead::FapTTVS** (*/TTVS/FapTTVS.h/.cpp*), just like **CSTHead::FapMandarin**, **CSTHead::FapCantonese**, or **CSTHead::FapEnglish**.

### Support of Cross-platform

It is also possible to run the TTVS engine on different platforms, as the following figures illustrate.
